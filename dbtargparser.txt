    1) What looks familiar?
    2) What don't you understand?

What I understand

General
- some arguments have default vs. some do not  default is returned when no argument is supplied
- type enforces data integrity of what user enters in CL
- Recognize a lot of arguments from our exercises like "deps", "snapshot", "source"

Specific
- Line 262: add_help=False means you are not able to run -h or --help to better understand the function

What I do not understand

General
- How a class works
- What the * signifies before args and kwargs (key word arguments?)
